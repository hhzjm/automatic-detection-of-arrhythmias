# automatic-detection-of-arrhythmias
A novel method for automatic detection of  arrhythmias using the unsupervised convolutional neural network

Takes data from the atrial fibrillation database from Physionet, and attempts to detect that atrial fibrillation using a number of statistical methods. Matlab code

The data sets loaded into this code are found at: http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/afdb/
