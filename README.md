# automatic-detection-of-arrhythmias
A novel method for automatic detection of  arrhythmias using the unsupervised convolutional neural network.

Takes data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database from PhysioNet (http://www.physionet.org) .
This work combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), lateral connection to propose the building blocks of  lateral connection convolutiona  for cardiac arrhythmia detection, which learn representations in an unsupervised manner.
